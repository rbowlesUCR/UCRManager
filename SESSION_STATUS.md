# Development Session Status - November 15, 2025

## Completed Features ✅

### 1. ConnectWise Status Filtering
- **Status**: ✅ Complete and Tested
- **What**: Filtered ConnectWise status dropdown to show only relevant statuses
- **Allowed Statuses**: New, In Progress, Acknowledged, Responded, Close Pending, Closed, Don't Change
- **Impact**: Cleaner UI, less confusion for operators

### 2. ConnectWise Time Entry Bug Fix
- **Status**: ✅ Complete and Tested
- **Problem**: Emoji characters in logging caused JSON parse errors, preventing time entries
- **Solution**: Removed all emoji characters from console.log statements
- **Result**: Time entries now created successfully with notes

### 3. Phone Number History Tracking
- **Status**: ✅ Complete and Tested
- **What**: Automatic history tracking in phone number notes field
- **Tracks**:
  - Assignments (who, when, policy, by whom)
  - Releases (from whom, when, by whom)
  - Removals (explicit removal operations)
  - Bulk assignments (marked as "bulk")
- **Format**: `[2025-11-15T16:29:56.123Z] Action description`
- **Files Modified**: server/routes.ts (added `appendPhoneNumberHistory` helper)

### 4. Old Number Release Bug Fix
- **Status**: ✅ Complete and Tested
- **Problem**: When replacing a user's number, old number stayed marked as "used"
- **Root Cause**: Database stores numbers with `tel:` prefix, but lookup was done without prefix
- **Solution**: Added `tel:` prefix back before database lookup (server/routes.ts:2703)
- **Result**: Old numbers properly released to "available" pool when replaced

### 5. Number Inventory Search
- **Status**: ✅ Complete and Tested
- **What**: Added search bar to filter phone numbers
- **Searches**: Phone number, Display Name, User Principal Name
- **Type**: Client-side filtering (instant results)
- **File**: client/src/pages/number-management.tsx

### 6. Enhanced Request Logging
- **Status**: ✅ Complete
- **What**: Added unique request IDs for tracing ConnectWise operations
- **Format**: `[Dashboard][1731685234567-abc123] START ConnectWise logging...`
- **Benefit**: Easy to trace a single request through frontend → backend → ConnectWise

## In Progress / Pending 🚧

### 7. Column Customization for Number Inventory
- **Status**: 🚧 Partially Complete (50%)
- **Completed**:
  - Added state management for visible columns
  - Added state for column order
  - Added search UI
- **Remaining**:
  - Column customization dialog/panel
  - Dynamic table headers based on visible columns
  - Dynamic table cells based on visible columns
  - Drag-and-drop column reordering
  - Save column preferences (localStorage)
- **Next Steps**: Complete the UI and dynamic rendering in next session

## Files Modified

### Backend (server/)
- **server/routes.ts**
  - Added `appendPhoneNumberHistory()` helper function
  - Updated 4 locations to track history (assign, bulk assign, release, remove)
  - Fixed old number release bug (tel: prefix)
  - Added requestId extraction for enhanced logging

### Frontend (client/src/)
- **client/src/pages/dashboard.tsx**
  - Added enhanced ConnectWise logging with request IDs
  - Fixed emoji characters causing JSON errors

- **client/src/pages/number-management.tsx**
  - Added searchQuery state
  - Added search input UI
  - Added client-side search filtering

## Git Status

**Branch**: `feature/connectwise-enhancements`
**Last Commit**: `af39ad1` - "feat: Add ConnectWise enhancements and number management improvements"
**Pushed**: ✅ Yes, pushed to GitHub

## Testing Status

### Tested and Working ✅
1. ConnectWise status filtering - Only shows allowed statuses
2. ConnectWise time entry creation - Works with notes
3. Phone number history - Appends to notes on assign/release/remove
4. Old number release - Properly freed when replaced
5. Number inventory search - Filters by number/name/UPN

### Not Yet Tested
1. Column customization UI (not fully implemented)

## Next Session TODO

1. **Complete Column Customization**:
   - Create column selector panel with checkboxes
   - Make table headers dynamic (only show checked columns)
   - Make table cells dynamic (only render checked columns)
   - Add drag-and-drop for column reordering
   - Save preferences to localStorage
   - Add "Reset to Default" button

2. **Optional Enhancements**:
   - Add column width adjustment
   - Add ability to freeze certain columns (checkbox, phone number)
   - Add export with selected columns only

## Known Issues

None currently - all implemented features are working correctly.

## Database Changes

No schema changes required. Using existing `notes` field in `phone_number_inventory` table.

## Performance Notes

- Search is client-side (fast for current data volumes)
- If inventory grows >1000 numbers, consider server-side search
- Column customization is UI-only (no performance impact)
